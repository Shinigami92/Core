## Welcome to JEMGEngine (DEV Rev 2.0)##

**JEMGEngine** is a multiplatform game engine.

### Installation ###

Currently we develop the complete API for the game engine. If the first build available you only need to include the JEMGE Libs in your Java project.

### Information ###

What is the `android-virtual.jar`: This Lib is intended solely for troubleshooting. If you don't have installed the ***Android SDK*** or if you use the online building (JEMGE Connect), load this Lib into your project.

### Examples ###

We provide a lot of examples. Check out the example directory!
